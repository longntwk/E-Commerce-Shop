# Welcome to my Repository - E-Commerce-Shop Project

## Overview

This project is a web application with a backend built using Spring Boot and a frontend developed using Angular. The application is designed to facilitate sales, providing features such as user login, registration, product management, and order processing. The backend leverages Java Spring Boot to build a RESTful API that supports these core functionalities.

## Features

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- RESTful API design
- Integration with MySQL Database using JPA/Hibernate
- Security features implemented with Spring Security
- Logging and Exception Handling

### Frontend (Angular)
- Responsive UI/UX with Angular Material/Bootstrap
- Routing and Navigation
- State Management using NgRx (optional)
- Form Handling and Validation
- API Service Integration with HttpClient

## Prerequisites

### Backend
- Java 17 or later
- Maven 4.0
- Spring Boot 3.3.1

### Frontend
- Node.js 16.x or later
- Angular CLI 15.x or later

## Project Status

Currently, the E-Commerce-Shop project is my personal project and is not yet complete. Based on the progress assessment, it is about 60% finished. I am actively working to complete the basic functions as described above. In the future, I plan to add features such as product comments, expand the login functionality to include social network accounts, and implement many other customer-related features. The important goal of this project is to deploy E-Commerce-Shop to a production environment where users can provide feedback and comments. This feedback will allow me to refine and optimize the product based on user experiences.

Thank you for taking the time to read my sharing. Have a nice day!
